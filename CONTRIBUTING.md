# Documenation

Documentation is generated using [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/).
We have a documentation folder where we store the source files.

Take a look at some of the existing files to get an idea of how to structure your documentation,
such as `index.rst` and `modules.rst`, or the [History doc](https://github.com/divergex/dxlib/blob/main/docs/source/history/history.rst).
We use ReStructuredText (RST) for formatting.
