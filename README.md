# dxlib - A Quantitative Finance Library

Built using Python, **dxlib** focuses on providing a comprehensive set of tools for quantitative finance. 

The library is designed to be easily adapted and used with other libraries such as **pandas** and **numpy**, 
and inserted into existing workflows.

## Motivation

Seeing as some existing libraries targeting quantitative development already exist, 
the goal of **dxlib** is to provide easier and act as a more maintainable library for both
big and small projects.

- **QuantLib** is a great library, but it is not as easy to use as **dxlib**.
- **pandas** and **numpy** are great, and should be used in conjunction with **dxlib**.
- **QuandL** has been archived, and **dxlib** is a great alternative.

All modules and classes are built using Domain Driven Design, and are designed to be easily understood and used.
I myself come from a computer science background, 
and whenever starting a new quant project, always found my code to end up extremely convoluted and messy.
Therefore, I believe creating a library with a strong foundation rather than a collection of scripts is the way to go.

All classes and methods are supposed to be easily serializable, deserializable, and extendable - to be freely used in a distributed and/or parallel environment.
